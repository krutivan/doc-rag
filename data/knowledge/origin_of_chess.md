# 🏰 Origins and Early History of Chess

## 1. Roots in Ancient India (≈ 6th–7th Century CE)

- **Chaturanga**, meaning “four divisions” of the army (infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariotry), emerged in northern India during the Gupta Empire era (~6th century CE).  
- It was played on an **8×8 ashtāpada board**, simulating war strategy and military formations :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- The original game was often played with **dice**, and the pieces moved more slowly than in modern chess; rules varied across regions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 2. Spread to Persia: Chatrang → Shatranj

- Chaturanga traveled west to **Sassanid Persia**, becoming **chatrang** and later **shatranj** under Islamic influence (~600–700 CE) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- The Persian game introduced the term **“shāh”** (king), which evolved into English **“check”**, and “[shāh māt]” (“the king is helpless”), yielding **“checkmate”** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- Pieces were renamed: the **counsellor (vizier)** on the board preceded the modern queen, and **elephants/bishops**, **knights/cavalry**, **rooks/chariots**, and **pawns/infantry** retained Persian names :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

## 3. The Islamic Golden Age: Chess Flourishes

- Chess became central to Islamic society after 633–651 CE, evolving into part of scholarly and literary culture :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
- In Baghdad (~840 CE), **al‑Adli ar‑Rumi** authored the earliest known chess manual, *Kitāb ash‑Shatranj* :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  
- **As-Suli** wrote *Kitab Ash‑Shatranj* and formalized strategies around the 10th century :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

## 4. Migration to Europe via Iberia (10th–11th Century)

- Arab conquest introduced chess to al‑Andalus; by the 10th century, evidence shows crystal chess sets in Spain (~1058 CE) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  
- The **“Versus de scachis”** (10th-century Latin poem from Einsiedeln Abbey) is the earliest technical European text on chess and mentions the **queen (regina)** and **checkerboard** :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

## 5. Medieval Europe & Rule Evolution (12th–15th Century)

- By the 12th–13th centuries, the **black-and-white board pattern** and double-move pawn rule appeared in Spain and Italy :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  
- Around 1475 in Valencia, Spain, the modern moves of the **queen** and **bishop** emerged; the queen transformed from a weak vizier to the most powerful piece :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.  
- Additional rule changes: **pawn promotion**, **castling**, and **stalemate** refinements occurred through the 14th–17th centuries :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.

## 6. Chess as a Renaissance Pastime & “Game of Kings”

- By the 16th century, chess was a refined courtly pursuit: Ruy López (Spain) authored foundational analyses in 1561 :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.  
- Shakespeare, Baldassare Castiglione, and others referenced chess as a metaphor for strategy, nobility, and intellect :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.  
- Printing presses began circulating treatises (e.g., Caxton’s *Game and Playe of the Chesse*, 1474) :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.

## 7. Chess in Modern Times: Organizing, Engines & Culture

- Wilhelm Steinitz established scientific chess in 1886; FIDE formed in 1924 to oversee global competition :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.  
- IBM’s **Deep Blue** famously beat Garry Kasparov in 1997, marking AI’s rise in chess :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.  
- The Netflix series *Queen's Gambit* (2020) and events like PogChamps invigorated mass interest :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.

## 8. Trivia & Cultural Legacy

- The legendary **rice-and-chessboard problem** (doubling grains) highlights exponential growth—though likely apocryphal :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.  
- Chess influenced mathematics, computer science, and education; one famous test of memory and pattern recognition was by psychologist Adriaan de Groot :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}.  
- Today, chess is played in **172+ countries**, with ~605 million adult players globally; the UN even declared **World Chess Day** on July 20 :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.
